# Socket Connection Issues & Solutions

## üö® **Issues Identified**

### 1. **Frequent Socket Disconnections**
- Users getting disconnected repeatedly during development
- Socket reconnection not working properly
- Development mode causing socket instability

### 2. **Runtime Errors**
- Fast Refresh causing full page reloads
- Type mismatches in refactored code
- Missing error boundaries

### 3. **Slow API Responses**
- `GET /api/auth/session` taking 3-36 seconds
- Performance issues affecting user experience

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions Implemented**

### **Solution 1: Improved Socket Client Configuration**

**File**: `src/lib/socket-client.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added development mode detection
- Improved reconnection settings for development:
  - Development: 15 attempts, 300ms delay, 1000ms max delay
  - Production: 5 attempts, 1000ms delay, 5000ms max delay
- Added better timeout settings for development
- Enhanced disconnection logging with specific reason codes
- Added development mode warnings about Fast Refresh

**Benefits**:
- Faster reconnection in development mode
- Better handling of Fast Refresh disconnections
- More informative logging for debugging

### **Solution 2: Error Boundary Component**

**File**: `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

**Features**:
- Catches React runtime errors
- Prevents full page reloads
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Provides retry and reload options
- Shows detailed error info in development mode

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@/components/common'

<ErrorBoundary>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### **Solution 3: Socket Status Monitoring Hook**

**File**: `src/hooks/socket-hooks/useSocketStatus.ts`

**Features**:
- Monitors socket connection status in real-time
- Tracks connection/disconnection counts
- Provides debugging information
- Helps identify connection issues

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { useSocketStatus } from '@/hooks/socket-hooks'

const socketStatus = useSocketStatus()
console.log('Connection count:', socketStatus.connectionCount)
```

## üîß **Additional Recommendations**

### **For Development Mode**:
1. **Wrap Critical Components** with `ErrorBoundary`
2. **Monitor Socket Status** using `useSocketStatus` hook
3. **Expect Disconnections** during Fast Refresh (this is normal)

### **For Production**:
1. **Optimize API Performance** - investigate slow auth sessions
2. **Add Connection Monitoring** to track real user disconnections
3. **Implement Graceful Degradation** when sockets are unavailable

## üìä **Expected Results**

After implementing these solutions:

1. **Fewer Full Page Reloads** - Error boundaries catch runtime errors
2. **Better Socket Stability** - Improved reconnection logic
3. **Faster Recovery** - Better handling of development mode disconnections
4. **Better Debugging** - Enhanced logging and status monitoring

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the improvements** in development mode
2. **Monitor socket connection logs** for better understanding
3. **Investigate slow API responses** (auth sessions taking 3-36 seconds)
4. **Add error boundaries** to critical components
5. **Consider implementing** connection health checks

## üìù **Monitoring Commands**

To monitor socket connections in development:

```bash
# Watch for socket connection logs
grep -i "socket" logs/development.log

# Monitor API response times
grep "GET /api/auth/session" logs/development.log | grep -o "in [0-9]*ms"
```

The socket disconnections in development mode are expected due to Next.js Fast Refresh, but the improved reconnection logic should make them much less disruptive to the user experience.
